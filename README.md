# Parameter Estimation Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains solutions to parameter estimation problems using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). There are two main problems addressed:
1. Estimating parameters of a Normal Distribution.
2. Estimating a parameter of a Binomial Distribution.

## Problem Descriptions
### Problem 1:
Given a random sample of size `n` from a Normal Population with parameters mean = ùúÉ1 and variance = ùúÉ2, the task is to find the Maximum Likelihood Estimates (MLE) of these two parameters.

### Problem 2:
Given a random sample from a Binomial Distribution with parameters `m` (known positive integer) and Œ∏ (unknown, ‚àà (0, 1)), the objective is to compute the value of Œ∏ using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) method.
